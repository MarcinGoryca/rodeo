Mona (Rodeo Game Engine) [ Project ]
-----------------------------
<h3>This was my thesis project, but I didn't finish it within required time.</h3>
<h3>I still want to get it working in some way. I think it is a great subject to explore.</h3>
<h3>Great to learn and have fun.</h3>

<h3>Another thing to consider is to make it more multimedia program, with wide use for animation, designing etc.</h3>
